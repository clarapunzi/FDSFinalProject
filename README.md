Project Name: Home Credit Default Risk

Project Score: 0.78230 (Public), 0.77501 (Private)

Project Description: The aim of this project is to build a model based on machine learning and statistical methods to help Home Credit predict their clients' repayment abilities. We have built our model according to the following steps:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis

 1.1. Analysis of the distribution of the target column

 1.2. Aggregation of the train and test datasets, detection of anomalies

 1.3. Processing of the other available datasets, anomaliesâ€™ detection and aggregation to a single dataset; definition of new features from aggregation phases

 1.4. Encoding categorical variables and removing missing values

2. Feature Engineering

 2.1. Domain knowledge features

 2.2. Dimensionality reduction

  2.2.1. Standardization of the features

  2.2.2. PCA

3. Logistic Regression Model

 3.1. LightGBM on reduced dataset

 3.2. LightGBM on full dataset
